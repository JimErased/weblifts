# Weblfits
## What is weblifts?
Weblifts is a work in progress tool for the displaying of workout data. By importing a CSV file exported from the Android app Hevy, it can convert it into a json file. The json file is then passed into ChartJS and rendered on a canvas to show a graph of different lifts, showing how many have been performed. By clicking on a bar, it will update the lower graph to show progression of the heaviest weight lifted, or 1RM.

## What's next?
Support for displaying different data such as set volume over time.
